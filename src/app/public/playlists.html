	<h1>Playlist Saviour</h1>
	<h3>Secure your playlists now!</h3>
	<p>You know what they say: It's always good to have a backup!</p>
	<p>On this website, you can download the most important information about your playlists and their tracks.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Info</h3>
	<p><b>What information is saved and how?</b></p>
	<p>playlist info: name, track count, and tracks with their respective info about name, duration, artist name and their id, album name and its id, track number, and track id <br> all of this information is stored in a single .json file, a common format for data objects.</p>
	<p><b>what can one do with this file?</b></p>
	<p>Well, just keep it somewhere, just in case something goes wrong with your spotify account, their servers or whatever</p>
	<p>soon coming: a program to upload playlists to your account via the spotify API</p>
	<p><b>How does one use this service?</b></p>
	<p>Just press on the button below! You will be redirected to the spotify authorization service, where you need to input your credentials to grant this application access to your playlist information. <br>you can revoke the access rights for this application at spotify TODO: link <br>thanks to modern authorization standards, this application never actually sees your credentials, so your data stays safe!</p>
	<p><b>Why did I program this?</b></p>
	<p>Basically, just for the joy of doing it, spotify has a pretty cool API and I encourage you to check it out yourself! TODO: insert link <br>also, you can check out the code for this project on GitHub TODO:link</p>
